Hi, I’m @ChrisSmithCodes

I studied computer science and coding through school, but there were many specific fields that my classes never covered.

I will be using this GitHub repository as a self taught course to get me more familiar with different languages and concepts including:

 * Python
 * Java
 * C/C++
 * ASP.Net
 * Javascript
 * Bash (mostly scripting)
______________________
* Neural Networks
* AI
* Embedded Systems
* Every-day scripting
* And anything else I think of...

If anyone happens to find the Repository and has any ideas as to fun projects that will challenge me and allow me to better understand modern computing, be sure to message me on GitHub or email: ChrisSmithCodes@gmail.com
